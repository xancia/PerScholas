EXTRA FEATURES:

- Create a Reset button so that the game only clears the board if the button is clicked. When the game ends, the board should no longer be clickable, but should not reset automatically

- Add a slight pause (using a setTimeout) before showing the winning or drawing alert message to allow the DOM to finish updating the board

- After a player wins, highlight their winning pattern in some way (bold, color, animate)

- Add a scoreboard to the top of the page that keeps track of wins

- Add an option to "play the computer" where the player plays as "X" and the computer randomly selects a spot during their turn as "O". Use setTimeout to make the timing of the computer more realistic
